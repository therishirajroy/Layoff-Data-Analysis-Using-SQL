# Layoff Data Analysis Using SQL

## Overview  
This project is an adaptation of the excellent MySQL-based SQL tutorial created by **Alex The Analyst**, originally featured in the YouTube video *‚ÄúLearn SQL Beginner to Advanced in Under 4 Hours‚Äù* ([Watch Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT1RErkfLNQ)). Leveraging his content, I've translated and enhanced the SQL scripts for compatibility with **Microsoft SQL Server**, adapting MySQL-specific syntax and techniques as needed.

---

## Contents  
- **SQL Server Scripts** (`.sql` files)  
  Modified versions of Alex‚Äôs original MySQL scripts, fully functional in SQL Server (T-SQL).

- **Mapping Document** (`README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`)  
  Highlights key syntax changes, such as:  
  - MySQL `LIMIT` ‚Üí SQL Server `TOP` or `OFFSET‚Ä¶FETCH`  
  - Backtick-quoted identifiers ‚Üí SQL Server bracketed identifiers  
  - MySQL date/time functions ‚Üí T-SQL equivalents (e.g., `NOW()` ‚Üí `GETDATE()`)

- **Sample Data Files** (if included)  
  Test datasets adapted for SQL Server import (if applicable).

- **Usage Instructions**  
  Step-by-step guidance to run the project on SQL Server, including prerequisites, execution commands, and environment setup.

## Purpose & Motivation  
This adaptation helps users familiar with Alex The Analyst‚Äôs MySQL examples by providing a **SQL Server‚Äìcompatible version**‚Äîideal for students, professionals, or enthusiasts who prefer or require Microsoft‚Äôs SQL dialect. It‚Äôs a learning bridge between MySQL and SQL Server, highlighting practical differences and smooth conversions.
